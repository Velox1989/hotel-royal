          <img src="./img/guest-2.png" alt="Benjamin">
          <p>The room was really nice and spacious, perfect if you are going to stay several days because all the closet space, full kitchen, washer and dryer. Loved the pool area and water park, great for kids. The only thing I didn’t like was the delivery zone, you could hear when a delivery was being made in your room pretty loudly, we were on the 3rd floor.</p>
